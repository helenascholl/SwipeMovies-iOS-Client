# SwipeMovies-iOS-Client

## Getting an API Key

For the application to work properly you need a
[TMDb API Key](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).

Create a file called `SwipeMovies-iOS-Client/auth.xcconfig` and paste the
API Key there:

```
TMDB_API_KEY=[Your API Key]
```
